HOW TO INSTALL git-missing
==========================

You simply need to copy the file 'git-missing.sh' to where
the rest of the git scripts are stored. 

From the Git bash window just run:

install.sh 

Or if you have the full Cygwin installed, you can use make:

make install

That will make a 'git missing' (note: space instead of dash) command
available.  See the file git-missing.txt for more.

You can also install the man page by doing:

	make doc
	cp git-missing.1 /usr/share/man/man1/
